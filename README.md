# FiftyTwoTimer
A timer that gives you 52 minutes of work vs 17 minutes of break based on research for maximum productivity http://goo.gl/uxNTwB

Currently just trying out Swift with this project. I thought it would be a good beginner project for a newbie programmer. Initially I repurposed a Stopwatch project initially from @rictyran https://github.com/rictyran/Stopwatch (thanks!!!)

Would love to see this turn into a Mac app too eventually.
